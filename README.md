# Somniloquy

Canvas app made in C# and Monogame. 
Had key fuunctionalities of having a canvas that is virtually infinite to all directions, with infinite hierarchial layers to be created.
Layers could be in two forms - TextureLayer and TileLayer - TextureLayer just tiled textures, self-explanatory, and TileLayer involved copyable tiles effectively implementing a tilemap editor.
Abandoned after switching to Rust as my main language.
