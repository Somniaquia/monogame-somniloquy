Initial Encounter with Cynnamon
Stratus steps through the glowing doorway into what she expects will be another strange, abstract landscape of the Latent Space. Instead, she finds herself standing on a ground that seems to be a bizarre patchwork of cobblestones and grassy knolls, with gravestones popping up randomly from the earth like forgotten thoughts. The sky is overcast, but every few seconds, a cloud randomly bursts into confetti, followed by a faint sound of a party horn.

Suddenly, the earth below her feet trembles, and from a mound of dirt, Cynnamon emerges, wielding her comically tiny shovel. She digs as if she’s been at it for hours, even though she’s barely moved any dirt. With a grunt, she tosses the tiny bit of soil over her shoulder, then looks up and notices Stratus standing there, watching.

Cynnamon:
"Oh-ho, what do we have here? Someone lost, or just taking a shortcut through life's big joke?"
She stands, dusting off her already dirt-streaked clothes and squints at Stratus with an exaggerated, suspicious glare.
"Wait a minute... I know that look. You're not here for the graves, are ya? Pity! I was just about to offer a two-for-one deal on existential crises. One dig, two burials, and you walk away with your very own questions about the meaning of life—free of charge!"

Cynnamon tosses the shovel aside—it lands with a comedic thunk—and saunters over to Stratus, hands on her hips, grinning broadly.

Stratus:
"I’m not sure I need an existential crisis today. Just passing through."

Cynnamon:
"Ah, passing through, like wind through a sieve, like an idea through a politician's brain. Always moving, never settling. That’s life, innit? Not that I would know, of course. I'm stuck here—permanently ‘digging’ up the past, you could say."
She taps the side of her head knowingly.
"Memory space, funny place. The more you dig, the less you understand. But hey, you might find a good joke down there if you're lucky."

As she says this, a nearby gravestone suddenly topples over, revealing that it was hollow and filled with jumbled-up letters that spill out across the ground. Cynnamon raises an eyebrow at the sight.

Cynnamon:
"Well, that’s a plot twist if I’ve ever seen one. Most people bury their secrets, but looks like someone buried the alphabet instead. Good luck reading that eulogy."

Stratus watches, trying to stifle a smile as Cynnamon ambles toward the mess of letters, picking one up and holding it in the air triumphantly.

Cynnamon:
"Look, a capital ‘Q’! Not every day you find a question lying around waiting to be answered, eh?"
She flicks the ‘Q’ over her shoulder and turns back to Stratus with a smirk.
"So, you’ve come to poke around, then? People usually don’t stumble into my little paradoxical paradise unless they’re looking for something specific. Or unless the universe has played a funny little trick on them. Which is it, love? Searchin' for truth or just trippin' over fate?"

Stratus:
"I’m here for the memories, to understand them… maybe change them."

Cynnamon:
"Change, eh? That's the biggest joke of all. Change a memory, and you change nothing. Change yourself, and you still stay exactly who you were. It’s all just one big cosmic laugh track."
She leans in conspiratorially, eyes twinkling.
"But don’t worry, I’m not here to ruin your fun. I’ll just keep digging, literally and metaphorically. Maybe you’ll find what you’re looking for... or maybe you'll just find a bunch of buried punchlines. Life's funny like that."

Cynnamon winks and picks up her tiny shovel again, dramatically pretending to dig with exaggerated motions, as though her effort is accomplishing something profound.

Cynnamon:
"Let me know if you need help finding anything! Or if you stumble across a joke that’s buried too deep to dig out on your own."

With that, she resumes her “work,” humming a nonsensical tune under her breath as she shovels an absurdly small amount of dirt. Stratus, caught somewhere between confusion and amusement, steps further into the memory space, unsure whether she’s found a spirit who can help her… or just one who will keep her laughing in circles.


Reintroduction of Cynnamon
As Stratus steps into this shared memory space, the atmosphere shifts between oppressive and oddly light. On one side, the heavy, solemn air of Mia’s despair; on the other, a space that feels oddly buoyant, where contradictions float like balloons tethered to gravestones. The ground itself is inconsistent—sometimes solid, sometimes squishy, as though reality itself is undecided here.

From the far end of the space, a familiar tune starts humming, off-key and absurd. Out of nowhere, Cynnamon appears from behind a tombstone, hoisting her comically tiny shovel over her shoulder. Her pumpkin head twists slightly as though considering something amusing, the carved grin a little too wide.

Cynnamon:
"Well, look who dug herself in and out again. Welcome to the paradox playground! Careful where you step—thoughts are slippery around here, and you might just trip over an irony or two."
She gives Stratus a wink before glancing over at Mia, her grin growing more wry.
"Ah, Mia’s around, too. Always loved her work. Not every spirit can make a tragedy look so beautiful and a joke feel like a funeral."

Mia’s presence hangs heavy on the other side, her shadows curling in on themselves, whispering softly. Cynnamon twirls her shovel like it’s a baton and marches between the two spaces, carelessly dancing on the line between humor and sorrow.

Cynnamon:
"See, between you and me, this place is a bit of a cosmic comedy club. Mia here, well, she gives me the material, and I… I make sure no one forgets to laugh. It's a service, really."
She leans in closer to Stratus, lowering her voice conspiratorially.
"Even the darkest corners need a little light now and then. Or a punchline."

She abruptly stands up straight and tosses the shovel into the air. It vanishes into the sky, as though swallowed by the contradictions around her. She shrugs dramatically.

Cynnamon:
"So, what’ll it be? You here for some deep thoughts, a quick joke, or just trying to make sense of it all?"
Her pumpkin head tilts, a single glowing eye flickering briefly.
"Not that sense ever made much sense to begin with."

Stratus watches as Cynnamon ambles forward, the boundary between Mia’s heavy, brooding atmosphere and Guffa’s light, chaotic one seeming to shift with her movements. It’s clear that these two spirits, though opposites in tone, are deeply interconnected, each offering something vital in their own way.
