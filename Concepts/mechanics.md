# Somniloquy Mechanics
## The Latent Space
Explore an expansive 3D World, composed of complexly composed and interconnected areas that invokes feelings of dreaming. 
- Latent space behaves differently from what we would expect from the real world. It would essentially be portrayed as an alternative world with a set of different rules that gave arisement of a completely different world. 

- The term Latent Space comes from Latent Vector Spaces of generative neural net structures such as the Variational Autoencoder, but our setting does not really relate with the term.  
### Yume 2kki-esque Area Interconnections

### Omnibus Story Progression
New stories can be unlocked as new areas get unlocked as players gain new abilities that enable them to visit them, just like in a Metroidvania game, but with much more storyline.  

The game's story is divided into **Clusters**. Each cluster serves as various characters' **Core Memory Spaces**, memories which the characters' consciousness are based on. Each cluster has its own minor characters, society, theme and backstories, and is compromised of several interconnected worlds. 

- Different clusters are seperated by large area of void between them, capturing how Local Clusters are seperated by immense void in our universe. Highways exist between Clusters, and Spirits can use those special lengthy connections to travel to a new cluster.

- A cluster might be as big as several qzy/wataru journeys, but one can be much smaller or larger too. This provides a way to effectively keep the story easy to be interpreted, by using different layers of hierarchial structures to segment the story. This clustering will also provide variety in game's progression, regreshing the playes' experiences to the beginning of the unkown where things are new and mysterious again.

- Every cluster has different paradigms of world construction in general, with different connection, puzzle styles or battle mechanics. 

- Each cluster having different characteristics would help resolve the problem of 'power inflation' of typical RPGs where enemies of subsequent areas are much more tougher than enemies of previous areas. A cluster would have an associated mechanic and a way to bypass these easily. Inhabitants would have strong Vector2Is of weaknesses that differ from inhabitants of a different cluster - the protagonist would need to start fresh in order to adapt to a new cluster. 

- A typical story construction of a cluster would look like: Discovery (Exploring game mechanics) -> Meeting a new character at a new area -> cheerful sessions -> discovering their anxieties -> climax (use of various learnt game mechanics of the area) -> escape -> calm session -> encounter -> truth and resolvation

## Action-Puzzle Hybrid
- The game will feature an action-puzzle hybrid system, blending platforming elements with intricate puzzles that require real-time reflexes and strategic thinking.

- Dynamic Reality Shifting: Players can shift between different layers of reality, each with unique rules and properties, to solve puzzles and navigate the world.

- Memory Manipulation and Reconstruction: Players can collect, manipulate, and reconstruct memories to solve puzzles and influence the world.

- Spirit Fusion and Transformation: Players can fuse with other spirits to gain new abilities and alter their appearance, reflecting the absorbed core memories. This mechanic combines puzzle-solving and strategic decision-making.

- Temporal Manipulation: Players can manipulate time within the game world to solve puzzles, uncover hidden memories, and alter the flow of events, similar to mechanics in Braid or the Portal mod Thinking with Time Machines.

### Dynamic Reality Shifting

- Players can shift between different layers of reality, each with its own rules and properties.

    - Layered Worlds: The game world exists in multiple layers, such as a dream layer, a memory layer, and a subconscious layer. Players can shift between these layers to solve puzzles and progress.

    - Environmental Changes: Shifting layers alters the environment in significant ways. For example, a blocked path in the dream layer might be open in the memory layer.
    
    - Puzzle Integration: Many puzzles require players to shift between layers to manipulate objects, find hidden paths, or alter the behavior of spirits.

### Memory Manipulation and Reconstruction
- **Memory Fragments:** Scattered throughout the world are memory fragments that the player can collect. Each fragment contains sensory and emotional data - they symbolically represent train data, in the game's story's case, a diverse collection of various memories of experiences and emotions. In the game's fictional setting, conscious **Spirits** arise from agglomeration of these memories, The protagonist is one of these Spirits.

- **Memory Reconstruction:** Players can piece together memory fragments to form coherent memories. The way memories are reconstructed can alter the environment or unlock new areas. For instance, reconstructing a memory of a joyful event might light up a dark area or make a hostile spirit friendly. Conversely, reconstructing a sad memory might reveal hidden paths shrouded in sorrow.

- **Emotional Resonance:** Different combinations of memory fragments can create different emotional resonances, which can change how NPCs interact with the player or alter the player's abilities.

Spirit Fusion and Transformation

Players can fuse with other spirits to gain new abilities and alter their appearance, reflecting the absorbed core memories.

    Fusion Abilities: Absorbing other spirits grants the player new abilities based on the absorbed spirit's core memories. These abilities can be used for exploration, combat, or puzzle-solving.
    Transformative Effects: Fusing with spirits also changes the protagonist's appearance, reflecting the absorbed memories and altering interactions with the environment and NPCs.
    Strategic Choices: Players must choose which spirits to absorb, balancing the benefits of new abilities with the potential drawbacks of new weaknesses or altered interactions.

Temporal Manipulation

Players can manipulate time within the game world to solve puzzles, uncover hidden memories, and alter the flow of events.

    Time Rewind: Players can rewind time in specific areas to see past events, revealing hidden clues or changing the outcome of certain actions.
    Temporal Puzzles: Some puzzles require players to manipulate time, such as freezing it to bypass moving obstacles or accelerating it to grow plants instantly.
    Epoch Repetition: The concept of repeated epochs can be integrated as a gameplay mechanic, where players revisit previous epochs with new knowledge and abilities, altering the outcome of their journey.

Narrative-Driven Combat System

Combat is deeply integrated with the narrative, focusing on persuasion, emotional manipulation, and strategic thinking rather than straightforward fighting.

    Emotional Battles: Combat encounters are resolved through dialogue and emotional manipulation. Players use collected memories and emotional insights to persuade, intimidate, or comfort opponents.
    Memory Attacks: Players can use reconstructed memories as 'attacks' to influence the opponent's emotional state, leading to different outcomes based on the chosen strategy.
    Moral Choices: The way players handle combat encounters can affect the story and the world, leading to different moral and ethical consequences.

Enhanced Exploration and Action Integration

Incorporate platforming and real-time action elements to keep the gameplay engaging and challenging.

    Hybrid 2.5D Perspective: Use a 2.5D perspective where the camera provides a side-view but allows depth movement, similar to games like Little Nightmares or Ori and the Blind Forest. This can offer platforming elements without sacrificing artistic expression.
    Isometric Perspective: Implement an isometric perspective, which combines top-down and side views, offering a balance between exploration and platforming. Games like Bastion or Transistor successfully use this perspective to blend action and artistic elements.

## Player Evolution
Implement player evolution in a skill tree-like manner, inspired by the progression of cognitive abilities in species.

- Vision Evolution: Similar to how human babies develop their vision over time, the protagonist's vision and perception will evolve, starting from seeing rough silhouettes to fully detailed environments.

- Fluency of Movement: Improve movement abilities as the player progresses, allowing for more complex navigation and interaction with the environment.

- Oneironautic Abilities: Develop abilities that allow the player to manipulate the dream-like world, such as reality shifting and memory reconstruction.

- Enhanced Working Memory: Increase the number of eye markers the player can place, enhancing their ability to perceive and interact with the environment.

Incorporation of Neuroscientific and Psychological Concepts

- Emphasize themes of consciousness and the nature of being through gameplay and narrative, structuring the perceived unknown.

- Use abstractions of human cognitive processes, displaying subconscious and conscious thoughts distinctly within the game. In the Latent Space, where consciousness and spatial representations are homogeneous, these thoughts might be broadcasted to nearby conscious beings, adding complexity to interactions and the story.

- Emotions, pain, concentration, and other factors will be used as in-game statuses affecting gameplay. Inspired by the 'Sanity' values in Don't Starve, the game will feature Emotions, Vividness, and Control as defining statuses that influence how the world is perceived and interacted with.

- Narrative-Driven Combat System: Combat involves persuasion, emotional manipulation, and strategic thinking rather than straightforward fighting. Players use collected memories and emotional insights to influence opponents, leading to different outcomes based on chosen strategies.
