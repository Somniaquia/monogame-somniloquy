There's a child sitting on the crest of a wave, but the wave never breaks because it's not water - it's made of time, bending and flexing like light through a prism. The child tries to scoop it up but finds their hands vanish into its folds, like grabbing at sunlight. What happens when the wavve crashes? Do we find ourselves older or younger, or are we simply pulled into someone else's dream? Maybe the clouds know, but they've been silent ever since the moon got stuck in reverse.

I once thought the sea could talk if you listened close enough. Not to the crashing waves, but to the silence between them. It's always between where the meaning hides, like reading letters carved into the gaps between stars. But here, in this space, they sky isn't made of stars butfloating fragments of forgotten conversations - half-finished thoughts that drift like dandelion seeds. You can catch one if you're fast enough, but it will dissolve into nothing if you try to hold on for too long. 

A ladder stretches upward into the sky, its rungs growing thinner the higher you go until they become threads, then whispers. You're climbing, but are you really going anywhere, or is the ladder a Mobius strip looping back to the same point you started from? Maybe ladders are just another illusion. Maybe the ground is, too. 

There's a box in the middle of a room with no walls—just vast, endless space. The box isn’t important, except that it hums like it’s dreaming of something. When you open it, there’s nothing inside, but the nothing is louder than the humming ever was. Maybe the box didn’t contain an object, but the echo of an idea. You close it, but now you hear the hum in your own chest, like the box passed its dream to you.

If you touch the ground, you’ll fall up. I know this because I’ve tried it before. But falling doesn’t feel like falling, it feels like remembering, as if every inch you rise is pulling old memories out of your bones. If you fall far enough, you might find yourself back at the beginning, in a room with a box that’s not quite awake yet. Or maybe you’ll end up in a memory that doesn’t belong to you, and you’ll have to find your way out by rearranging the furniture until it looks like home.

The stars above aren’t stars. They’re just holes poked through the ceiling of the universe, and beyond them is the color you see when you close your eyes and press your palms against them. Maybe that’s why it’s so dark out there—because we’re seeing what’s behind the world, where all the forgotten things go to sleep. Sometimes they wake up, but only in dreams, when nobody’s paying attention.

I once found a door in the middle of a field, but it wasn’t attached to anything. The door opened into a garden, but the garden was upside-down, with trees hanging like chandeliers and rivers that flowed toward the sky. I tried stepping inside, but I kept falling up, landing right back where I started. Maybe the garden was a test. Or maybe the door was just confused.

If you listen carefully to the silence, you’ll hear the sound of someone waiting. But don’t answer—it’s not for you.
